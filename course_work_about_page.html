            Our hub spans over 100,000 square feet, strategically located in Kowloon’s High-
            Tech Park, where we collaborate closely with local universities, research
            institutions, and industry leaders. The Visionary Innovation Hub is home to over

            We emphasize a student-centered approach by encouraging undergraduate students to
            engage in research and development activities from their first year. Our innovative
            environment allows students to join research groups and projects, fostering
            collaboration and hands-on experience. To enhance their global perspectives, we
            offer various opportunities for overseas study and internships at prestigious
            institutions, including Harvard University and MIT.

            providing invaluable guidance and expertise. The hub features three distinct zones:
            the Technology Zone, Innovation Zone, and Ecology Zone, each designed to support
            specific areas of research and development. We have created a robust
            entrepreneurial ecosystem, resulting in the establishment of 370 spin-off
            companies, with 114 founded in 2024 alone.
